	abstract = {In light of the rapid recent retreat of Arctic sea ice, a number of studies have discussed the possibility of a critical threshold (or {\textquotedblleft}tipping point{\textquotedblright}) beyond which the ice{\textendash}albedo feedback causes the ice cover to melt away in an irreversible process. The focus has typically been centered on the annual minimum (September) ice cover, which is often seen as particularly susceptible to destabilization by the ice{\textendash}albedo feedback. Here, we examine the central physical processes associated with the transition from ice-covered to ice-free Arctic Ocean conditions. We show that although the ice{\textendash}albedo feedback promotes the existence of multiple ice-cover states, the stabilizing thermodynamic effects of sea ice mitigate this when the Arctic Ocean is ice covered during a sufficiently large fraction of the year. These results suggest that critical threshold behavior is unlikely during the approach from current perennial sea-ice conditions to seasonally ice-free conditions. In a further warmed climate, however, we find that a critical threshold associated with the sudden loss of the remaining wintertime-only sea ice cover may be likely.},

abstract = {A sea ice concentration and motion assimilation scheme has been developed using the Met Office Forecasting Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM). FOAM has been upgraded to include a more realistic sea ice rheology and a sea ice thickness distribution. The sea ice data assimilation scheme uses Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI) and QuikSCAT satellite observations to provide ice concentration and motion. A number of 1-year test integrations have been undertaken, and the resulting sea ice analysis has been examined in detail. The assimilation is able to significantly reduce the model sea ice concentration error and is able to address the model biases. Owing to the faster response times of the elastic-viscous-plastic (EVP) sea ice rheology in the model compared to the viscous-plastic used in previous studies, a novel approach to sea ice motion assimilation using increments to the ice stress has been developed. The sea ice motion assimilation scheme is able to reduce the model sea ice velocity errors by approximately 50\% when compared to independent data. Ice velocity assimilation was found to have little impact on the ice concentration, and ice concentration assimilation is found to have little impact on ice velocities. This implies that ice concentrations are primarily thermodynamically controlled and ice velocities are primarily dynamically driven. During the summer, model biases and poor-quality observations impair the performance of the assimilation.}

    abstract = { Abstract A three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) system has been developed to provide analyses of the ice–ocean state and to initialize a coupled ice–ocean numerical model for forecasting sea ice conditions. This study focuses on the estimation of the background-error statistics, including the spatial and multivariate covariances, and their impact on the quality of the resulting sea ice analyses and forecasts. The covariances are assumed to be horizontally homogeneous and fixed in time. The horizontal correlations are assumed to have a Gaussian shape and are modeled by integrating a diffusion equation. A relatively simple implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter is used to produce ensembles of the ice–ocean model state that are representative of background error and from which the 3DVAR covariance parameters are estimated. Data assimilation experiments, using various configurations of 3DVAR and simpler assimilation approaches, are conducted over a 7-month period during the winter of 2006/07 for the Canadian east coast region. The only data assimilated are the gridded daily ice charts and RADARSAT image analyses produced by the Canadian Ice Service. All of the data assimilation experiments produce significantly improved short-term forecasts as compared with persistence. When assimilating the same data, the forecast quality from the experiments employing either the 3DVAR, direct insertion, or nudging is quite similar. However, assimilation of both the daily ice charts and RADARSAT image analyses in 3DVAR results in significant improvements to the sea ice concentration forecasts. This result supports the use of a data assimilation approach, such as 3DVAR, for combining multiple sources of observational data together with a sophisticated forecast model to provide analyses and forecasts of sea ice conditions. }

abstract="An implementation of the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a coupled ice--ocean model is presented. The model system consists of a dynamic--thermodynamic ice model using the elastic-viscous-plastic (EVP) rheology coupled with the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). The observed variable is ice concentration from passive microwave sensor data (SSM/I). The assimilation of ice concentration has the desired effect of reducing the difference between observations and model. Comparison of the assimilation experiment with a free-run experiment shows that there are large differences, especially in summer. In winter the differences are relatively small, partly because the atmospheric forcing used to run the model depends upon SSM/I data. The assimilation has the strongest impact close to the ice edge, where it ensures a correct location of the ice edge throughout the simulation. An inspection of the model ensemble statistics reveals that the error estimates of the model are too small in winter, partly a result of too low model ice-concentration variance in the central ice pack. It is found that the ensemble covariance between ice concentration and sea-surface temperature in the same grid cell is of the same sign (negative) throughout the year. The ensemble covariance between ice concentration and salinity is more dependent upon the physical mechanisms involved, with ice transport and freeze/melt giving different signs of the covariances. The ice-transport and ice-melt mechanisms also impact the ice-concentration variance and the covariance between ice concentration and ice thickness. The ensemble statistics show a high degree of complexity, which to some extent merits the use of computationally expensive assimilation methods, such as the Ensemble Kalman filter. The present study focuses on the assimilation of ice concentration, but it is understood that assimilation of other datasets, such as sea-surface temperature, would be beneficial.",

A method is presented where a fast atmospheric radiative transfer model and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model fields are used to correct brightness temperatures before they enter the sea ice concentration algorithm. The skill of the method is a function of the errors in the NWP model fields modulated by the sensitivities of the sea ice concentration algorithm used. The NWP model fields representing the most significant atmospheric parameters, i.e. water vapour, cloud liquid water, surface temperature and wind speed over open water are evaluated using remote sensing data. For wind speed and total water vapour, it is found that the standard deviation of the difference is less than the RMS error quoted for the remote sensing algorithms. The best consistency is found for water vapour followed by wind speed. The NWP model cloud liquid water displays standard deviations much higher than the RMS error of the remote sensing algorithm and close to the total average content. Nine sea ice concentration algorithms are further evaluated in a sensitivity study to the above-mentioned atmospheric constituents using a detailed atmospheric radiative transfer model. The result shows that the class of algorithms based solely on the 19 and 37 GHz vertically polarised channels display the smallest sensitivity to all three atmospheric parameters: total water vapour, wind speed and cloud liquid water. Finally, it is demonstrated that this method overcomes many problems associated with conventional weather filtering over mixed ice-water and new-ice pixels and allows the retrieval of sea ice concentrations below 10%."

abstract = { AbstractIn this paper a method to directly assimilate brightness temperatures from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) to produce ice concentration analyses within a three-dimensional variational data assimilation system is investigated. To assimilate the brightness temperatures a simple radiative transfer model is used as the forward model that maps the state vector to the observation space. This allows brightness temperatures to be modeled for all channels as a function of the total ice concentration, surface wind speed, sea surface temperature, ice temperature, vertically integrated water vapor, and vertically integrated cloud liquid water. The brightness temperatures estimated by the radiative transfer model are sensitive to the specified values for the sea ice emissivity. In this paper, two methods of specifying the sea ice emissivity are compared. The first uses a constant value for each polarization and frequency, while the second uses a simple emissivity parameterization. The emissivity parameterization is found to significantly improve the fit to the observations, reducing both the bias and the standard deviation. Results from the assimilation of brightness temperatures are compared with those from assimilating a retrieved ice concentration in the context of initializing a coupled ice–ocean model for an area along the east coast of Canada. It is found that with the emissivity parameterization the assimilation of brightness temperatures produces ice concentration analyses that are in slightly better agreement with operational ice charts than when assimilating an ice concentration retrieval, with the most significant improvements during the melt season. }
